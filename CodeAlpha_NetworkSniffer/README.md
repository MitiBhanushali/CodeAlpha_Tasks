# 🔐 CodeAlpha – Basic Network Sniffer

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **basic network sniffer** developed as part of the  
**CodeAlpha Cyber Security Internship**.

The program captures **live network packets** and displays key details such as:
- Source IP address  
- Destination IP address  
- Protocol type  
- Timestamp  


## 🎯 Objective
The objective of this project is to understand:
- How data packets travel over a network  
- How network traffic can be monitored and analyzed for security purposes  


## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- **Scapy Library**
- **VS Code**
- **Windows 10**

> ⚠️ **Note:** Administrator / root privileges may be required to run this program.


## ⚙️ How It Works
- The program uses the **Scapy** library to capture live network packets.
- It checks whether the packet contains **IP data**.
- Source and destination IP addresses are extracted.
- The protocol type (**TCP / UDP / Other**) is identified.
- Each packet is displayed with a **timestamp and packet number**.


## ▶️ How to Run the Program
1. Open **Command Prompt** or **VS Code** as **Administrator**.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install Scapy (if not already installed):
    pip install scapy
4. Run the program:
    python sniffer.py
5. Open any website to generate network traffic.
6. Press **Ctrl + C** to stop packet capture.


## 📊 Sample Output
[1] 15:42:10 | TCP | 192.168.1.5 → 8.8.8.8


## 🎓 Learning Outcome
- Understanding of **network packets and protocols**
- Hands-on experience with **packet sniffing**
- Exposure to **basic cybersecurity concepts**


## ⚠️ Disclaimer
This project is developed **strictly for educational purposes** as part of a cybersecurity internship.  
It should only be used on **authorized networks**.
