SECURE CODING REVIEW REPORT

Language: Python
Application: Simple Login Program

I selected a basic Python login program for this task.
Initially, the password was checked directly in the code which is not secure.

Security Issue:
The password was handled in plain text, which can be easily seen
by anyone who has access to the source code.

Improvement:
To improve security, I used password hashing using the hashlib module.
This prevents the password from being checked directly.

Learning:
This task helped me understand basic secure coding practices
and why protecting passwords is important.
