SECURE CODING REVIEW REPORT

Language: Python  
Application: Simple Login Program  

Project Overview:
This report documents a secure coding review of a simple Python
login program as part of the CodeAlpha Cyber Security Internship.

The initial version of the program contained insecure coding practices
that could expose sensitive information.

Insecure Code (Before Secure Coding Review):

The following code represents the original implementation of the login
program. It contains security issues such as hardcoded credentials.

username = input("Enter username: ")
password = input("Enter password: ")

if username == "admin" and password == "admin123":
    print("Login successful!")
else:
    print("Invalid credentials")

Security Issues Identified:
- Username and password were hardcoded in the source code
- Password was handled in plain text
- No input validation or secure authentication method was used
- Not suitable for real-world applications

Secure Version (After Review):

After reviewing the code, secure coding practices were applied.
Hardcoded credentials were removed and password hashing was used
to avoid storing or comparing passwords in plain text.

The hashlib module was used to hash the password before comparison,
making the authentication process more secure.

Improvements Made:
- Removed hardcoded username and password
- Applied password hashing using the hashlib module
- Improved code structure and readability

Learning Outcome:
This task helped me understand the importance of secure coding practices,
especially in authentication systems. I learned how insecure handling
of passwords can lead to security risks and how hashing helps protect
sensitive data.
